# CAP4784
This repository has been created in order to facilitate group work for Team "Eva" on the CAP4784 Data Analytics Project's 4th deliverable.

## Goal
To understand the relationship between conditions contributing to death and age among COVID-19 patients.

## Plan
Build a table that describes the mean, median, mode, range, variance, quartiles, and standard deviation of all numeric columns for each age group.
This should be done separately for each data set in order to handle the differences in age group reporting between data sets. Inferences about this data can then be drawn from this data accordingly.

## Data
The data sets are too large for Github, and will need to be added to the data/ directory after the repository is cloned. Empty directories cannot be uploaded, so you will need to create this as well.

The data sets can be found here: https://uofnorthflorida-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/n01413497_unf_edu/EvBvM2uibMBAuxUOp63nJuQBLtIH3-K2zH_07mEaypTfeg?e=QAJWyT
